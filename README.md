# Auction-Management-System

####**Description**
• A Java swing application developed during my Application Engineering and Development(INFO 5100) class at Northeastern University to provide a common platform for Dealers to sell their products and customers to bid on them, a Delivery entity to deliver products and a System Analyst to provide insights on the best dealer and customers.

####**Key Functionalities**
• The system administrator can add in multiple Dealer and the Customer organization’s into the system. 
• The system will have a login functionality for both customers and the dealers for authentication. 
• The dealers can create auctions and add products to it which will be available for bidding.
• The customer can access the auctions and bid on the products of their interest. 
• After a minimum of 5 bids is completed the system will sell the product to the highest bidding customer who can then request delivery to the Delivery Organization.
